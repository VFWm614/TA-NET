# TA-NET
This repo is the implementation of "[TA-NET: Empowering Highly Efficient Traffic Anomaly Detection through Multi-Head Local Self-Attention and Adaptive Hierarchical Feature Reconstruction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457982)".

# Datasets and extracted features
**The original video data for the TAD dataset and the UCF-crime dataset can be obtained from the following links:**
> [**TAD dataset**](https://github.com/ktr-hubrt/WSAL)
> 
> [**UCF-crime dataset**](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/)

Since our TA-NET focuses on traffic anomaly detection, we constructed a subset of the UCF-crime dataset containing only traffic scenes, named UCF-crime-traffic. The file partitioning for UCF-crime-traffic can be obtained from **UCF-crime-traffic index** in this project:


**Additionally, we also provide video features extracted by UniformerV2 for convenient use:**
